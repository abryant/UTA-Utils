The idea of these utilities is simple.

- parseAutotest, given an autotest results file as an argument, makes a
  directory within the current directory for each student, and fills each one
  with their source files plus a file for tests/results. It also produces
  a printable .ps version of each, using enscript.

- printAutotest, with the optional argument -p to make it print straight away,
  generates a pdf file per student from all their files' generated postscript
  versions, and optionally (given -p) prints these directly to ICTMono, syntax
  highlighted and separately stapled in landscape (two columns)
